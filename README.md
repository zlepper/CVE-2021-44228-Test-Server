# CVE-2021-44228-Test-Server
A small server for verifing if a given java program is succeptibel to CVE-2021-44228

# Usage
Build the program using `go build -o listener.exe`. This should give you a small executable for your platform. 
Use the Go cross compile feature if you need the executable for another platform. 

Once you have the executable you can run it using:
```sh
$ listener
```

By default the program listens on port `4568`, but that can be changes by passing in a `-port` argument to the executable. 

Once the executable is running make the problematic program log `${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1:4568/a}`. The running application should log every time a request
comes in, so you can see if it fits with your expectations.
